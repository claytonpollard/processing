"thunderstorm"

[The program has some flashing lights]

You can download either the standalone program (windows only), or all 3 scripts required for the program to run. Either should work.

Important: There's an effect which requires the program to be windowed in order to function properly. Without it the whole thing would be pretty underwhelming.

How to use:
Move the mouse left & right to control the direction of the rain
Move the mouse up & down to control the intensity of the rain (move down to increase intensity, move up to reduce intensity)
Click to create a lightning strike.

Ethan's sketch wasn't compatible with Processing.js so it was refactored to run in p5.js. It might not be identical to Ethan's original sketch.
